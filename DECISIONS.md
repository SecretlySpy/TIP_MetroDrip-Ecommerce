# MetroDrip Architecture Decision Register

- **Scope:** Tasks A-1 and A-2
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Authority:** Extends the locked decisions in `MetroDrip_AI_Handover.md` section 11.
- **Change rule:** Update this register when an implementation intentionally changes one of these contracts.

## ADR-A-001 — Domain application count

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** MetroDrip has 10 first-party Django apps: `catalog`, `inventory`, `orders`, `payments`, `shipping`, `notifications`, `accounts`, `reviews`, `cms`, and `storefront`.
- **Rationale:** The project structure and current functional requirements define 10 domain boundaries. The phrase "7 apps" in Task A-1 is a stale count from before the checklist-driven account, community, and content additions.
- **Consequences:** Keep all 10 apps installed. Do not merge or remove apps merely to satisfy the stale count.

## ADR-A-002 — Product category cardinality

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** A `Product` belongs to exactly one `Category` through a required foreign key.
- **Rationale:** The schema field list specifies singular `category_id`; the ER diagram's many-to-many-looking marker is ambiguous.
- **Consequences:** Category filtering and administration use one category per product in v1. Multiple categories require a future explicit migration to a join table. A category referenced by a product is protected from deletion.

## ADR-A-003 — Authentication model

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** `accounts.Customer` is the custom `AUTH_USER_MODEL` from the initial migration. It uses unique email authentication and has no username field.
- **Rationale:** Customer profiles, saved addresses, wishlists, order history, and Django permissions need one stable account identity. Replacing Django's user model after migrations is unsafe.
- **Consequences:** All user relations use `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`; no code imports Django's concrete `User`. `AUTH_USER_MODEL = "accounts.Customer"` must be set before the first migration is generated or applied.

## ADR-A-004 — Guest identity and checkout ownership

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Guest checkout creates no `Customer` row. A guest `Order` has `customer = NULL`; its immutable checkout snapshot in `shipping_address` must include the guest's email, name, phone, and delivery address.
- **Rationale:** An order is a commercial record, while a customer row represents an actual registered account. Creating passwordless pseudo-accounts would conflate those identities and collide with later registration by the same unique email.
- **Consequences:** Guest status is determined by `Order.customer_id is None`. A verified order-claim flow may later attach matching-email guest orders to a newly registered customer. Deleting a customer sets existing order ownership to `NULL` and does not delete the orders.

## ADR-A-005 — Unusable passwords

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** An unusable password is an authentication state, not a guest-identity marker.
- **Rationale:** Registered accounts created for invitation, administrative setup, or password-reset workflows may temporarily have unusable passwords; guests have no customer row at all.
- **Consequences:** Do not implement `Customer.is_guest` as `not has_usable_password()`. Do not create a guest with `create_user(email, password=None)`. Code determines guest ownership only from the nullable order relation.

## ADR-A-006 — MySQL driver

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** PyMySQL is the v1 MySQL driver and is installed through `pymysql.install_as_MySQLdb()` before Django initializes its MySQL backend.
- **Rationale:** It is pure Python, works consistently across the supported development platforms, and supports the transactions and row locks required by the inventory design without a native compiler toolchain.
- **Consequences:** `PyMySQL` is a runtime dependency. Django continues to use `django.db.backends.mysql`; application code does not depend on driver-specific APIs.

## ADR-A-007 — Storage engine and character set

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Every environment uses MySQL 8 with InnoDB tables and `utf8mb4`; this is configured before the first migration rather than repaired afterward.
- **Rationale:** Inventory correctness depends on real row-level locking and transactions, and the storefront must preserve the full Unicode range.
- **Consequences:** The MySQL server starts with `character-set-server=utf8mb4` and `collation-server=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`. Each Django connection sets `charset=utf8mb4`, `default_storage_engine=INNODB`, and strict SQL mode. The first catalog migration alters and verifies the active database defaults before creating domain tables and normalizes Django's pre-created migration-recorder table. Test databases explicitly use the same charset and collation. Migration QA verifies table engines and collations through MySQL metadata.

## ADR-A-008 — Inventory concurrency red contract

- **Status:** Accepted until Epic B-1; remove the marker when B-1 is implemented.
- **Decision:** Commit the two-buyers/one-unit concurrency test as `pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True)` while the atomic inventory service does not exist.
- **Rationale:** The repository instructions require post-change QA to remain green, while the handover requires the failing concurrency contract to exist before implementation.
- **Consequences:** The test must run against real MySQL/InnoDB and assert exactly one successful buyer. A normal failure is an expected red contract; an unexpected pass is a strict XPASS and therefore fails QA. B-1 must implement `transaction.atomic()` plus `select_for_update()`, remove the xfail marker, and make the same test pass normally.

## ADR-A-009 — Annual order number allocation

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Order numbers use `MD-YYYY-NNNNN`, where `YYYY` is the `Asia/Manila` business year and the counter starts at 1 for each year.
- **Rationale:** Computing `MAX(order_no) + 1` races under concurrent checkout.
- **Consequences:** One unique `OrderNumberSequence` row exists per four-digit year. Allocation occurs inside `transaction.atomic()` while holding `select_for_update()` on that row; Django recovers a first-row creation race under the unique year constraint. Numbers are unique and increasing within a year, but gaplessness is not promised. Allocation stops explicitly after `99999` so the locked five-digit format never widens. Sequence rows are retained.

## ADR-A-010 — Deletion policy

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Historical commerce and inventory evidence is retained; disposable/profile-owned data cascades; identity removal detaches orders.

| Parent or reference | Policy | Required behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `Category → Product` | `PROTECT` | A used category cannot be deleted. |
| `Product → ProductVariant` | `CASCADE` | Removing a never-used product removes its variants; protected history can still block the operation. |
| `ProductVariant → StockRecord` | `CASCADE` | A removable variant also removes its current counter row. |
| `OrderItem → ProductVariant` | `PROTECT` | A sold SKU cannot be hard-deleted. |
| `StockMovement → ProductVariant` | `PROTECT` | A SKU with ledger history cannot be hard-deleted; deactivate it instead. |
| `Order → Customer` | `SET_NULL` | Account erasure preserves the order and its checkout snapshot. |
| `WishlistItem → Customer/Product` | `CASCADE` | Profile-owned bookmarks disappear with either owner. |
| `Review → Customer/Product` | `CASCADE` | Removing the author or product removes its public review content. |
| `Review → Order` | `PROTECT` | Verified-purchase evidence protects its order. |
| `StockMovement → Order` | `PROTECT` | Referenced audit evidence protects its order. |
| `OrderItem/Payment/Shipment → Order` | `CASCADE` | Children follow an explicitly authorized order purge; normal application flows never hard-delete orders. |

- **Consequences:** `StockMovement` is append-only: application updates and deletes are rejected. Orders and catalog entities with history are archived or deactivated, not hard-deleted.

## ADR-A-011 — Cancellation and refund state edges

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** The only legal order transitions are:

| From | To |
|---|---|
| `pending` | `paid`, `cancelled` |
| `paid` | `packed`, `refunded` |
| `packed` | `shipped`, `refunded` |
| `shipped` | `delivered`, `refunded` |
| `delivered` | `refunded` |
| `cancelled` | none; terminal |
| `refunded` | none; terminal |

- **Rationale:** Cancellation applies only before confirmed payment. Once payment has been confirmed, the compensating exit is a refund.
- **Consequences:** Cancelling a pending order releases reservations but does not write a stock movement because reservations never changed `qty_on_hand`. Refunding restores stock exactly once with positive `return` movements and updates payment/order state atomically and idempotently. Direct status assignment is forbidden; services use the transition API.

## ADR-A-012 — Demo catalog and inventory seed

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** `seed_demo` creates the following stable catalog:

| Product | Category | Code | Colors | Base price (centavos) |
|---|---|---|---|---:|
| Metro Essential Tee | T-Shirts | `MTEE` | Jet Black (`JBLK`), Concrete White (`CWHT`) | 89900 |
| Skyline Pullover Hoodie | Hoodies | `SHOD` | Midnight Navy (`MNAV`), Asphalt Gray (`AGRY`) | 189900 |
| Transit Utility Cargo Pants | Pants | `TCAR` | Route Olive (`ROLV`), Signal Black (`SBLK`) | 219900 |
| Platform Twill Overshirt | Overshirts | `POVR` | Rust Line (`RUST`), Steel Blue (`STBL`) | 169900 |
| Night Route Windbreaker | Outerwear | `NRJK` | Neon Lime (`NLIM`), Carbon Black (`CBLK`) | 249900 |

- **Axes:** Each product gets all sizes `XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`, `XXL` × its two listed colors × all fits `slim`, `regular`, `oversized`: 36 variants per product and 180 variants total.
- **SKU:** `MD-{PRODUCT_CODE}-{SIZE}-{COLOR_CODE}-{FIT_CODE}`, with fit codes `SLM`, `REG`, and `OVR`.
- **Initial stock:** Every newly created variant has `qty_on_hand = 10`, `qty_reserved = 0`, and `low_stock_threshold = 5`.
- **Audit:** Creating a stock row and its single `+10` `restock` movement is one atomic operation.
- **Idempotency:** Stable category/product slugs and deterministic SKUs are natural keys. Re-running the command may update catalog metadata, but it never duplicates rows, resets an existing stock counter, or creates another initial movement for existing stock.
